# LLM-Assignments Repository

Welcome to the **LLM-Assignments Repository**! This is a growing collection of assignments focused on the exploration, analysis, and experimentation with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Whether you're diving deep into prompting techniques, probing model behaviors, or uncovering insights about how these models encode and retrieve information, this repository is your go-to resource.

## üöÄ What's Inside?

### 1. **Exploring and Probing Large Language Models**
   - **Assignment Overview**: In the first assignment, we explored the fascinating world of **Prompting** and **Probing** LLMs. We investigated how models like LLAMA 3.1 respond to specific prompts, and how their layers encode information differently. 
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - **Prompting**: Crafting questions and prompts to elicit responses from LLMs.
     - **Probing**: Examining how information is encoded across different layers of the model, and evaluating performance for regression and classification tasks.
   - **Findings**: We discovered how different layers of the model contribute to various tasks, such as regression (predicting IMDb ratings) and classification (predicting certificate categories).

Stay tuned for **future assignments**, where we'll dive into more advanced topics and challenges in the world of LLMs. There's much more to come!

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Repository

Each assignment is organized in its own directory, with detailed explanations, code, and results. You can navigate through the assignments to explore the research, code, and insights gained from working with LLMs.

### Getting Started
To run the experiments, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLM-Assignments.git
